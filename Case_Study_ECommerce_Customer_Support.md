# Case Study – E-Commerce Customer Support Efficiency & Satisfaction Analysis

## Business Problem
The company noticed inconsistent customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores and variable response times across its support channels. Management wants to identify which factors most affect satisfaction to improve performance and optimize agent scheduling.

## Objective
Analyze customer support data to:
- Identify which channels provide the fastest, most satisfying service.
- Determine top issue categories and their impact on satisfaction.
- Understand relationships between response time, shift, tenure, and CSAT.

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (time conversion, null removal).
2. KPI calculation: response time (min) and average CSAT.
3. Visualization of CSAT by channel, issue frequency, and response time vs CSAT.

## Results & Insights
- **Inbound** and **Outcall** channels dominate the dataset.
- Channels with faster average response times have higher CSAT.
- “Order Related” and “Product Queries” represent the most frequent complaints.
- Morning shifts and >90-day tenured agents tend to achieve better satisfaction scores.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize staffing for channels with high volume and low satisfaction.
- Offer additional training for low-performing agents or shifts.
- Implement response-time SLAs to reduce delays and improve CSAT consistency.

## Tools Used
Python · Pandas · Matplotlib
